# Summary

MultiSim is a Python package for simulating multivariate patterns in multi-channel and time-resolved neural signals. Users can flexibly specify the time windows, temporal dynamics, and size of the multivariate effects to simulate trial-by-trial epoched data according to custom experimental designs. The simulated data thus contain "ground truth" effects that can be used to benchmark multivariate analysis pipelines to establish their sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the toolbox can be used to perform power analysis, by varying the number of subjects and number of trials per subjects at fixed effect size and noise parameters to identify the optimal combination to ensure that their sample is properly powered.

# Statement of needs

Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is an established method in cognitive neuroscience for probing how the brain represents information [@ritchie2019decoding;@haynes2006decoding;@kriegeskorte2008representational;@haxby2001distributed;@poldrack2009decoding]. Applied to high-temporal-resolution electrophysiology signals such as electro- and magneto-encephalography (EEG and MEG respectively), MVPA can reveal the millisecond-by-millisecond unfolding of mental representations [@cichy2014resolving;@king2014characterizing;@king2016brain;@cogitate2025adversarial;@kok2017prior]. However, the parameter space of MVPA is large, and the sensitivity and specificity of analysis pipelines are often unclear. While real neural data can be used to benchmark pipelines, they often lack objective ground truth, making it difficult to systematically evaluate the performance of MVPA methods and make recommendations for studies.

Simulated neurophysiological data, on the other hand, could provide a solution. While several toolboxes can simulate EEG/MEG data—such as MNE-Python [@gramfort2013meg], FieldTrip [@oostenveld2011fieldtrip], Brainstorm [@tadel2011brainstorm] and unfoldSim [@schepers2025unfoldsim] — these are typically designed to model univariate ERP components, source-level activity, or general sensor-level signals. Critically, none allows researchers to specify multivariate effects with controlled timing, spatial structure, and strength, nor to systematically manipulate noise, channel covariance, and between-subject variability. As a result, there is currently no standard method to test the sensitivity and specificity of decoding pipelines, or to estimate, in advance, the number of trials and participants required to detect effects of a given size.

MultiSim addresses this gap by letting investigators simulate time-resolved multi-channel signals tailored to their recording setups, embedding multivariate effects with known spatiotemporal properties while flexibly controlling signal and noise parameters. The core of our simulation engine builds on and extends a function from the SPM toolbox [see DEMO_CVA_RSA.m, @tierney2025spm], which we adapted to support dynamic time-resolved signals and to give users direct control over effect size specification.

# Functionalities

The code block below provides a minimal example, highlighting the simplicity with which multivariate effects can be specified with our toolbox (see \autoref{fig:pipeline}**A** for a visual representation of key parameters):

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from multisim import Simulator

# 100 trials, 1 experimental condition
X = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(100, 1), columns=["face-object"])
effects = [{"condition": "face-object", "windows": [0.1, 0.3], "effect_size": 0.5}]
sims = Simulator(
    X,
    effects,
    noise_std=0.1,
    n_channels=64,
    n_subjects=20,
    tmin=-0.2,
    tmax=0.8,
    sfreq=250,
)
sims.summary()  # Should return 20 subjects
```

Our algorithm produces multi-subject datasets in which ground truth effects are known with precise timing (see \autoref{fig:pipeline}**B**). Furthermore, our pipelines enable full flexibility regarding the temporal dynamics of the effects (see \autoref{fig:pipeline}**C**) as well as the temporal generalization of the injected effects (see \autoref{fig:pipeline}**D**), enabling the simulation of all patterns presented by [@king2014characterizing] (Figure 2). By running custom analysis pipelines on simulated data, researchers obtain a direct read-out of its true-positive rate (can it recover the injected effects?) and false-positive rate (does it raise false alarms when nothing is present?). In addition, our simulator can be used to perform computational power analysis, to determine the number of trials and subjects, by iterating over these parameters.

![**Overview of the simulation and decoding framework.** **A**. General data parameters for the simulation. Left: `n_channels` corresponds to the number of channels in the montage. Middle: `X` represents the design matrix, with each column being an experimental condition and each row being a trial). Right: `ch_cov` is the channel-by-channel covariance matrix of the data to be simulated.  **B**. A minimal example with effects for two experimental conditions (category and attention) with large effect sizes. Left: `effects` is a dictionary that specifies the `"condition"`, time window (`"windows"`) and effect size (`"effect_size"`) of each effect to simulate. The example specifies an effect of category from 0.1 and 0.2 s with an effect size of 4, and an effect of the attention condition from 0.4 to 0.5 with an effect size of 4. Middle: the time-resolved activation of a single channel. Right: the resulting decoding accuracy (using a support vector machine classifier). **C**. Example of simulated effects with an added gamma kernel to simulate effects with biologically plausible temporal dynamics. Left: `effects` similar to that of B but with effect size of 0.5 for each condition. Middle: gamma `kernel`, specifying the temporal dynamics of the multivariate effect. Right: the resulting decoding accuracy. **D**. Example of simulated data with cross-temporal generalization of the category effect. Left: `effects` dictionary specifies two different time windows for the effect of category as a list. Middle: the resulting decoding accuracy. Right: temporal generalization of the decoding.\label{fig:pipeline}](figure1.png){width=100%}

In conclusion, MultiSim promotes best practices in MVPA by giving researchers a tailored benchmark for their specific experimental designs, a testbed for developing new decoding methods, and a principled way to check that planned studies are properly powered—ultimately enabling more reliable and efficient investigations of brain function.
